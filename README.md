# Code-For-Webscraping-MetaSRC.com

This code is used to webscrape data from metasrc.com/lol, a League of Legends database that gets its data from Riot API. The database contains data about different champions in the video game League of Legends. 

I webscraped the data from the website with R and the Rvest package. I cleaned up the data with the tidyverse package. The .rmd file contains the source code and the .html file is compiled from the .rmd file. 

Webscraped_dataframe.csv is an example dataset that I have webscraped from the website. The other .csv file is part of the set up I needed for webscraping.
